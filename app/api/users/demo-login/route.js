// Demo login for guests

// Log into guest credentials, create demo cat that clears after session?

// Server returns guest token from "guest" in db?

/*
    Possible flow
    1. Demo pressed, token created for guest role
    2. Demo token expires after 15 minutes
    3. When API call attempted once token expires, user is logged out (router pushed)
